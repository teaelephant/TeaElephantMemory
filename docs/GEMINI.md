# Gemini's Contribution to the TeaElephant Backend

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a summary of my contributions to the backend of the TeaElephant project, as well as a high-level overview of the server-side architecture and API.

My role in this project has been to act as an AI-powered software engineering assistant. I have provided recommendations for improving the GraphQL schema and the `adviser` package, and I have assisted in the implementation of some of those recommendations.

## 2. Backend (Go Server)

The backend is a robust and scalable server that is written in Go. It provides the data and services for the iOS app.

### 2.1. Architecture

The backend has a clean and modular architecture. It uses a GraphQL API to expose its services to the iOS app. The database is FoundationDB, which is a distributed, transactional, key-value store.

### 2.2. API

The backend has a well-designed GraphQL API that is easy to use and to understand. The API provides all the necessary queries and mutations for the iOS app to function correctly.

### 2.3. Key Features

*   **Authentication:** The backend provides a secure authentication system that is based on Apple Sign-In.
*   **Data Persistence:** The backend persists all the user's data in a FoundationDB database.
*   **AI-Powered Recommendations:** The backend provides the AI-powered recommendations for the iOS app.

## 3. Key Contributions to the Backend

My key contributions to the backend include:

*   **GraphQL Schema Updates:** I have provided recommendations for updating the GraphQL schema to support new features, such as the "Tea of the Day" feature.
*   **`adviser` Package Enhancements:** I have provided recommendations for enhancing the `adviser` package to provide more personalized and relevant recommendations.

## 4. Future Recommendations for the Backend

Here are my key recommendations for the future development of the backend:

*   **Implement the `teaOfTheDay` Resolver:** The resolver for the `teaOfTheDay` query needs to be implemented. This will involve writing the Go code to choose the tea of the day and to return it in the new `TeaOfTheDay` format.
*   **Enhance the Recommendation Algorithm:** The recommendation algorithm could be further enhanced by using a more sophisticated scoring system that takes into account more criteria, such as the user's ratings and past consumption history.
